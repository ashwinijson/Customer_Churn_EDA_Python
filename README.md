# Techno Customer Churn EDA 

## Background & Overview

This project focuses on understanding customer churn behavior using exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python.
The main objective is to identify the key factors leading to customer cancellations and provide meaningful recommendations that can help improve retention.

The dataset includes demographic details, service usage information, and billing data, allowing a detailed analysis of customer behavior.

## Executive Summary

The analysis indicates several strong patterns:

Customers with month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rate

Senior citizens tend to churn more frequently than other age groups

Electronic payment methods, especially electronic checks, are associated with higher churn

Customers in the early months of service are more likely to cancel

Higher monthly charges contribute to dissatisfaction and churn
